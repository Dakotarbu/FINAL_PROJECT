# Final project for Dakota Brubaker.

### For this final project I chose to look at a FiveThirtyEight data set on police killings in 2015. 
### Here is a link to the original article from [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/where-police-have-killed-americans-in-2015/).

### I chose this data set for two reasons:
* Although the data set is slightly older knowing how to 
ask questions around a topic as relevant as police shootings is important. 
* FiveThirtyEight is a reliable source for data with lots of information. 

#### The data set includes 468 recorded police killings in the United States from 2015. For each killing by police the CSV file gives information on: 
* The victim of police violence (age, race, gender, name)
* Location (Long, Lat, City, State)
* Demographics where violence occured (data on the census track/city where the killing occured)

As I first started looking at the data I had some initial questions: 
* How many of these victims of police violence were even armed? 
* Was police violence more prevelant in low income areas?
